# Hogwarts In My Pocket



This application contains all my knowledge about android development which I learned during my 5 weeks that I spent studying.  It uses the [Potter API](https://potterapi.com) for its informations.

It's aim is to help students who get their letter from Hogwarts, to register and onboard the school.

It includes the sorting hat, to get the student into a house, and also contains the spell curriculum which they can access and practice (at their own safety!)
